Hey! Iâ€™m AarÃ³n ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently studying Mechatronics Engineering at Tec de Monterrey. I love building things that move, think, and improve systems â€” from autonomous vehicles to control circuits and process optimization using Lean Six Sigma.

This space showcases the projects that have shaped my journey so far â€” technical, creative, and challenging in their own way.

Thanks for stopping by âœ¨
